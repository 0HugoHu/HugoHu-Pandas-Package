## Project Description
This project reads from a ```.csv``` file and filters the data based on the ```age``` column.

I also added unit test for this function.

## Run

To build and run the project, go to the ```Dockerfile```, and make sure your **Docker** is running on your computer.

You can hit the run button on the first line if you are using the PyCharm IDE:

Or you need to configure your Dockerfile configuration (please use all default values, connect to Docker Daemon on Mac with unix:///var/run/docker.sock):

Then, hit the run button, and the Docker image begins to build:

The output should be a string:
